# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Instructions, files, code for Lab 6.

In this activity we explore the concept of "servers."  Which typically aren't located where we are.

We would then have to connect to them remotely.

The purpose of this repository is knowing how to clone an existing repository into ones account on a server.

Then going into one of the files and making updates within that said file.
